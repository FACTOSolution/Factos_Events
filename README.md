### Token Header Format

The authentication information should be included by the client in the headers of each request. The headers follow the [RFC 6750 Bearer Token](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750) format:

### Authentication headers example:
~~~
"access-token": "wwwww",
"token-type":   "Bearer",
"client":       "xxxxx",
"expiry":       "yyyyy",
"uid":          "zzzzz"
~~~

The authentication headers consists of the following params:

| param | description |
|---|---|
| **`access-token`** | This serves as the user's password for each request. A hashed version of this value is stored in the database for later comparison. This value should be changed on each request. |
| **`client`** | This enables the use of multiple simultaneous sessions on different clients. (For example, a user may want to be authenticated on both their phone and their laptop at the same time.) |
| **`expiry`** | The date at which the current session will expire. This can be used by clients to invalidate expired tokens without the need for an API request. |
| **`uid`** | A unique value that is used to identify the user. This is necessary because searching the DB for users by their access token will make the API susceptible to [timing attacks](http://codahale.com/a-lesson-in-timing-attacks/). |

The authentication headers required for each request will be available in the response from the previous request. If you are using the [ng-token-auth](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/ng-token-auth) AngularJS module or the [jToker](https://github.com/lynndylanhurley/j-toker) jQuery plugin, this functionality is already provided.
